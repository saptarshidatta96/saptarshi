I love working with  Machine Intelligence and work with various Deep Learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. My website contains some projects executed by me, conceptual articles written by me and some external Knowledge Materials followed by me. They can be found [here](https://saptarshidatta.in/kb/).
