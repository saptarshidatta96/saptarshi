Hi, I am [Saptarshi Datta](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GgDpXJTwyoLLgdc6S9XiSt9C8U0HFuCn/view?usp=sharing). I am currently working as AI/ML Developer at Rapid Labs, TCS.

Earlier I worked as a Business Intelligence(BI) Engineer specializing in ETL Data Integration at TATA Consultancy Services.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and completed the Post Graduate Program in Business Analytics & Business Intelligence from UT Austin.

I am also pursing part-time MTech in Artificial Intelligence from IIT Jodhpur.

I am passionate about a lot of things and number crunching is one of them. Apart from this, I love to blog. In my free time, I like to relax a bit! :)
