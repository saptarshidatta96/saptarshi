Hi, I am [Saptarshi Datta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saptarshi-datta/). I am currently working as AI/ML Developer at [TCS Rapid Labs](https://www.tcs.com/tcs-rapid-labs). 

I have a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and completed the Post Graduate Program in Business Analytics & Business Intelligence from UT Austin.

I am also pursing part-time MTech in Artificial Intelligence from IIT Jodhpur.

I am passionate about a lot of things and number crunching is one of them. Apart from this, I love to blog. In my free time, I like to relax a bit! :)
