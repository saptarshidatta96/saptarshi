## Classical Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. It is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.

Here are a few materials:

- Statistics Book - Business Statistics - A First Course by David M. Levine, David F. Stephan, Kathryn A. Szabat, P.K. Viswanatha

- Head First Statistics  by Dawn Griffiths - Available at Safari Books Online

- YouTube Channel - StatQuest with Josh Starmer is a good place to start.

- Introduction to Statistical Learning in R (ISLR) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani

- YouTube video series of ISLR

- The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book by Andriy Burkov. This book will provide a concise understanding of various ML Algorithms. It comes with a wiki with additional information like Q&A, code snippets, further reading, tools, and other relevant resources. Having a prior understanding of various ML Techniques is advised.

- Python for Data Science. Taking some Udemy course will help.

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a sub field of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.

Here are a few materials:

- Deep Learning Book by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville

- Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng from Coursera

- Deep Learning Tutorial on Kaggle

- TensorFlow channel on YouTube

- [DeepLizard.com](https://deeplizard.com/) provides end to end high quality tutorials on Deep Learing with Keras, TensorFlow and PyTorch. Make sure to watch it.

- [Paperspace Blog](https://blog.paperspace.com/)

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1GQaVhO4f_jLxOokW7CS5kY_J1t1T17S) playlist on Evolution of Object Detection Networks
